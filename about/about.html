        <h2> What's Going On? </h2> 
        <div class="Info-no1"> <br>
            <p>In fall of 2023, the CSU Board of Trustees voted to implement a yearly tuition increase of 6% 
                over the course of five years. This is the first year it comes into effect. According to the SFSU financial aid website, the 
                average tuition cost is $8,256 for two semesters for the 2025-26 school year. This means that in five years the average cost will be 10,732 for just tuition. 
                On top of all this, around 300 lectures are being laid off which results in us as students paying more for less. </p>
        </div>
        <div class="titles">
            <h2> How does this affect you, the student? </h2>

            <h2> Some important statistics </h2> 
        </div>
        <div class="Info-no2"> <br>
        
           
                <p>The obvious answer is you will be paying more money. If you are an out of state student, 
                    you’re paying around $40K (depending on if any other fees increase as well) per year and 10K if you’re a commuter student. 
                    Beyond that, you may need to pay even more if you’re not able to graduate on time because of professor layoffs and class cuts. 
                    All of SF State’s financial burdens fall on us, all while the administers’ salaries increase by twice the rate than that of the teachers. </p>


                <p>Last semester, we lost 313 sections from our previous 2,991 total class sections. Now, we are expecting to lose even more after having another round of budget cuts. 
                Since 2020, class sections have declined by 29% over five years. Conversely, tuition since 2020 has gone from 7,006 to 8,256, demonstrating that we are getting less education for more money. 
                Now, with the 6% increase annually and even more cuts to education locally and federally, we are as students being harmed long term. </p>
