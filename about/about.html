        <h2> The San Francisco State University tuition fee from last year </h2>
        <br> 
        <br>
        <div class="Info-no1"> <br>
            <oll>
                <li> In Fall 2023, the California State University Board of Trustees
                    voted to implement a yearly tuition increase of 6% for five years.This is the first academic year
                    that it comes into effect. </li>
                <li> According to the SFSU Bursar’s Office, undergraduate students enrolled in over six units pay $3,042
                    this semester
                    — up from $2,871 in spring. Those enrolled in six units or under will pay $1,764 this semester —
                    from $1,665 in spring.</li>
                <li>Credential students enrolled in more than six units pay $3,531 ($3,330 in spring) and those enrolled
                    in six units or fewer pay $2,049 ($1,932 in spring) this semester.</li>
                <li>Graduate, post-baccalaureate, second degree, and master’s degree students pay $2,208 (spring:
                    $2,082) if they’re enrolled in six or fewer units and $3,804 (spring: $3,588) for more than six
                    units.</li>
                <li>The Education Doctorate program costs $6,273 per semester, up from $5,919 in spring.</li>

        <h2>Which campus fees were increased? </h2>
        <br>
        <br>
        <div class="Info-no2"> <br>
            <oll>
                <li>Campus fees were also increased this semester, from $773 in total last semester to $883 this
                    semester.</li><br>
                <li>From when the Gator Pass was implemented in 2017 to the 2022-2023 academic year, each student was
                    charged $180 per semester.
                    The Gator Pass fee last fall was $40, according to the Bursar’s Office.
                    Students voted to increase the fee to $130 to expand the pass to all public transit systems that
                    accept Clipper.</li> <br>
                <li>Other fees that were increased include the Student Health Service fee ($261 to $276), the Recreation
                    & Wellness Center fee
                    that funds Mashouf Wellness Center (from $178 to $181), and the Health Facilities Fee ($36 to $38).

        <h2> Can Tuition Fees be Waived? </h2> 
        <br>
        <br>
        <div class="Info-no3">
            <oll>
                <li>For most students, the Student Involvement and Representation Fee of $2 is the only waivable fee,
                    according to the Bursar’s Office.</li><br>
                <li>CSU employees and their dependents and spouses may have their fees waived and their tuition reduced
                    under a CSU program.</li><br>
                <li>On Thursday, April 17, 2025 The protest, hosted by the CFA and Student Union, was held to fight
                    against budget cuts and tuition hikes at California State University campuses, along with other
                    issues, including Palestine and the LGBTQ+ community.</li><br>
                <li>Professor Blanca Missé said that campuses are supposed to be sanctuaries for free speech, regardless
                    of views. She said, “And our goal here is to make sure that students in this campus, faculty and
                    staff, feel free speaking their mind — they don’t feel retaliated or intimidated, and they can find
                    the necessary solidarity to fight repression.”</li><br>
                <li>Brad Erickson, a liberal arts lecturer and the CFA chapter president, said he wants to fight against
                    the estimated 8% state funding cut that will result in another tuition hike and the loss of faculty.</li><br>
                <li>He said, “We need to prioritize teaching and learning as always. There have been cuts across the
                    board, but they’re disproportionately carried out on the backs of lecturer faculty, continued
                    faculty who are already among the most exploited, poorly paid educators in the state of California
                    right here at San Francisco State. So that’s part of the problem. We need to invest in our people
                    before we hire more managers and administrators and/or build new buildings.”</li><br>
                <li>Sean Connelly had this to say, “I no longer teach here. I was not rehired at the end of fall because
                    of budget cuts after 17 years of teaching. There are plenty of other people like me who lost their
                    jobs. Hundreds, actually, just at SFSU in the last year since fall.”</li><br>
                <li>James Martel, a tenure-track representative for CFA, said tuition hikes lead to student debt.</li><br>
                <li>“Students take out loans to pay for that debt, but they get nothing for it because they won’t spend
                    that money on instruction,” Martel said. “That is obscene. That’s something we absolutely cannot do
                    anymore. It’s totally unfair.”</li><br>
                <li>Students like Char Bennett, an American studies student, worry that this financial burden will
                    affect their future.</li><br>
                <li>Another issue that the CFA addressed during the teach-out was about the LGBTQ+ community. Amanda
                    Chang, a music student, expressed her discontent for President Trump’s administrative actions.</li><br>
                <li>“He is trying to ban transgender rights and transgender care, which is making me angry,” Chang said.
                    “Angry because everybody deserves equal protection.”</li><br>
                <li>Around noon, a large group of CFA protesters wearing different shades of red moved over to Malcolm X
                    Plaza holding megaphones, instruments and posters with phrases like “Stop the cuts,” “Defend higher
                    ed” and “Gators bite back!”</li><br>
                <li>Several clubs were tabling along with the CFA, handing out pizza, coffee, snacks and flyers to
                    students.</li><br>
                <li>Throughout the speeches on stage, several chants were repeated throughout the crowd — a recurring
                    one being, “The people united, will never be defeated,” followed by drum banging, trumpet blares and
                    people cheering.</li><br>
                <li>“I think for Asian American communities a lot of people don’t understand how these things can affect
                    them and affect their families,” Vi Lee said. “And I think it’s really important that people do know
                    that so they can protect themselves, protect their families. Make sure they know their rights, make
                    sure they don’t have to talk to ICE. They don’t have to open the door to ICE.”</li><br>
