            <p>
                Recent budget cuts and lay-offs have resulted in San Francisco State University scrambling to fix this deficit by putting this burden on students. Current attendees are expected to pay a higher tuition every year, while doing what they can with the dwindling classes and professors. All of this putting students and faculty last while the people at the top have their salaries increased every year. Learn more and help us fight this urgent issue.
